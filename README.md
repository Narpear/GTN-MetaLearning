# GTN-MetricLearning

This project is based on research on Metric Learning inspired Binary and Multiclass Classification of Graphs. 
The two parts of this project explore different metric learning methodologies (Siamese Networks and Prototypical Networks) to perform downstream tasks on graph-datasets. 

In the first part, we explore a novel pipeline, GTN (Graph Transformer Network) followed by a Siamese Network, to perform a binary classification of graphs, using the UPFD-Politifact dataset. 
In the second part, we explore another novel pipeline, GTN followed by a Prototypical Network, to perform a multiclass classification of nodes, using the CoAuthor dataset.
